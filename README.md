## SQL Server Developer


</div>

### Description

A must for the SQL Server Developer. Combines what developers use with Enterprise Manager and Query Analyser in one package as well as other features including a simple but effective stored procedure debugger, perfect for the beginning SQL developer. Search utility very helpful also. Requires 1024x screen resolution. Can handle multiple selects (max 10) at a time. Be sure to read the readme.txt file for extra features.
 
### More Info
 
Most of the features of SQL Server Developer are easily discovered by simply playing with

the application. The purpose of this readme file is to inform you of some things that are

not.

Clicking on a database will populate the top portion of the screen with the tables, stored

procedures and/or triggers that exist for that database.

Clicking on a table will populate a column list. Double clicking on the table listbox will

produce a sorted list easier to view.

Clicking on a column name will append it to the SQL text box.

Double clicking on a stored procedure or trigger will render the contents of the stored

procedure or trigger in a large text box which can be edited and altered back to the SQL

Server.

Double clicking on a recordset will render a full screen view of the recordset. The buttons

< and > on top or below a recordset will increase or decrease the column sizes. Right click

on a recordset and see what happens.

If you plan on using the stored procedure debugger, also make sure you have an empty line

after Inserts, Deletes, Updates and Deletes. Use the Set command to populate the paramaters

you will be using (for example Set @Name = 'George'). If using a cursor, always use the

Do While @@rowcount<>0.
